                    <p>
                    For this test assignment, we will be adding 2 numbers.

                    <p>
                    For this assignment, we have analyzed elevator data to determine the optimal place to stand while waiting for the elevator in CDS. After analyzing scatterplots, writing methods to process the data, and figuring out distances between each elevator, we have found the the optimal location to stand is slighty to the bottom right of the middle.

                    <h2>Assignment 3: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                    For this assignment, I implemented the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. I then applied SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset and explored how the number of dimensions impacts the performance of a classifier. To analyze these effects, I visualized the results, comparing the classifier's performance as the dimensionality was reduced, providing insights into the trade-offs between dimension reduction and accuracy.

                    <h2>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage</h2>
                    <p>
                    For this assignment, I developed an interactive web application that implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search engine will take a user's query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.
