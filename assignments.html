                    <p>
                    For this test assignment, we will be adding 2 numbers.

                    <p>
                    For this assignment, we have analyzed elevator data to determine the optimal place to stand while waiting for the elevator in CDS. After analyzing scatterplots, writing methods to process the data, and figuring out distances between each elevator, we have found the the optimal location to stand is slighty to the bottom right of the middle.

                    <p>
                    For this assignment, I implemented the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. I then applied SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset and explored how the number of dimensions impacts the performance of a classifier. To analyze these effects, I visualized the results, comparing the classifier's performance as the dimensionality was reduced, providing insights into the trade-offs between dimension reduction and accuracy.

                    <h2>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage</h2>
                    <p>
                    For this assignment, I developed an interactive web application that implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search engine will take a user's query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.

                    <p>
                    In this assignment, I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict customer churn for a bank. The goal was to identify customers likely to leave based on historical data and submit predictions in a mini Kaggle competition.

                    In this assignment, I predicted people's star ratings as accurately as possible based on their review.

                    <h2>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>
                    In this assignment, I explored how changing parameters affects linear regression. I created an interactive webpage that demonstrates the impact of modifying these parameters, particularly when there's no actual relationship between X and Y. By adjusting these settings, I observed how randomness influences the slope and intercept in the regression model, revealing the effects of parameter changes on the model's behavior.

                    <h2>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>
                        I extended my previous work from Assignment 6 by adding hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through simulations. I enhanced my interactive webpage to allow users to perform hypothesis tests on either the slope or intercept of the regression line and generate confidence intervals based on simulated values.

                    <p>
                        In this assignment, I conducted a Logistic Regression Cluster Shift Experiment, analyzing how the model's decision boundary, coefficients, and performance metrics adapt as clusters move apart, reducing overlap and improving separability.

                    <p>
                        In this assignment, I implemented a search system that supports text, image, and combined queries with adjustable weighting, and allows the use of principal component embeddings for image queries.
